    <h2>Introduction</h2>

    <h2>Example Stacked Chart</h2>

    <h2>Geographic Statistics</h2>
    <p>
      I created several regions to prevent a lot of tiny slices while
      grouping things geographically.  Australia and New Zealand are
      grouped with the one respondent each from South Korea and the
      Philipines who both listed English as their only language.  I've
      labeled this the "Pacific Anglophone" region.
    <p>
      The other regions are what you would expect, with the three
      largest country populations (U.S., U.K., and Canada) standing
      on their own.  Note that there is only one respondent in the
      "North Africa" region, an active indexer in Libya who indexes
      comics in Arabic.  Unlike with the Pacific Anglophone grouping,
      I decided not to put him in with Europe due to the language
      difference.  There were no other respondents from Africa or Asia.
    <p>
      <strong>Note:</strong> You can see the values as percentages by
      hovering over the pie slices.

    <h2>Gender</h2>
    <p class="side_text">
      Somewhat unsurprisingly, the majority of the GCD's audience consists
      of middle-aged men.  What is surprising is that the audience is not
      just majority male, but almost entirely male.  This holds true in
      similar proportiong across nearly all significant-size user groups.

    <p class="side_text">
      The one exception is that women make up 4.3% of visitors who come
      to the GCD for academic or other research.  The sample size is so
      small it is hard to say much, but it seems worthy of note.
