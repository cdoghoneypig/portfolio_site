      <h1>The Grand Comics Database: User Survey Summer 2016</h1>
    </div>

    <div class="report-body">
    <h2>Executive Summary</h2>

    <p>
        The Grand Comics Database (GCD) has huge global reach and the best data on the history of comic publishing. We conducted a survey of those visiting the website and collected 416 responses in 24 hours.
    </p>
    <p>
        This survey reveals several things. First, the GCD is not reaching everyone it should. The GCD could do better reaching women, young people, those exclusively interested in modern comics, and regions outside North America and Europe. To a large extent, these populations overlap, with European visitors, for example, often being younger. Second, those talking on the GCD lists do not represent the current userbase, let alone the userbase that the organization could potentially have.
    </p><p>
        Therefore, we recommend changes to the site that would help rectify these problems without downgrading the experience of the large current userbase, without which the GCD would be nothing at all. In particular, we recommend improvements to the site&#39;s ease of use and further research.

    <h2>
        Demographic Findings
    </h2>
    <p>
        The GCD could be attracting a wider range of visitors, which could increase site traffic, enhance quality of contributions, and serve the organization&#39;s mission of disseminating information on published comics of all eras and languages.
    </p>

    <h3>
            Language
    </h3>
    <p>
        GCD visitors overwhelmingly read comics in English, though the site includes comics in many other languages. 
    </p>

            <iframe width="808.5" height="499.81537656903765" seamless frameborder="0" scrolling="no" src="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1vxUuKct_UpPjYaT2iM37lG92ZWmyxDjtWBPq0LK1OJk/pubchart?oid=2138018366&amp;format=interactive"></iframe>
        </div>

    <h3>
        Gender
    </h3>
    <p>
        While <a target="_blank" href="http://www.comicsbeat.com/market-research-says-46-female-comic-fans/">the comics market may have as much as a 46% female readership</a>, the GCD&#39;s visitors are almost entirely men, with about 97% of survey respondents identifying as male. Unfortunately, this imbalance also makes it difficult to get representative data on the site&#39;s women users, as only about a dozen women completed a survey. Still, these respondents did tend to be noticeably younger, less concentrated in the US, more likely to use the site for academic work, and less likely to engage with the GCD&#39;s social media or mailing list.
    </p>

        <div id="gender" class="inline_chart"></div>

    <h3>
        Age
    </h3>
    <p>
        Internationally, comics and graphic novels have readership across age groups, with a substantial portion under 30. While the GCD&#39;s mission is different from comic sales, site visitors are considerably older than the wider universe of comic afficianados. 
    </p>
    <div class="chart">
        <iframe width="821.233153638814" height="507.87219730941706" seamless frameborder="0" scrolling="no" src="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1vxUuKct_UpPjYaT2iM37lG92ZWmyxDjtWBPq0LK1OJk/pubchart?oid=1027591699&amp;format=interactive"></iframe>
    </div>

    <p>
        Perhaps relatedly, almost all GCD visitors enjoy older comics, most also enjoy newer comics, but almost none read new comics exclusively. While we have not found comparative market data for the broader comic markets, this extreme preference stands out.

    <h2>
        Insiders are Different
    </h2>
    <p>
        While the GCD&#39;s volunteer membership comes from across the world, members of the board, mailing lists, and social media channels are not, of themselves, representative of users. The GCD must work to represent the concerns and hopes of its current and prospective users. Doing this requires better understanding who uses the site.
    </p>
    <h3>
        Few Insiders, Many Users
    </h3>
    <p>
        The GCD&#39;s mailing lists are the soul of the organization, but only include a tiny fraction of all users. Recent votes on GCD policies are often determined by around 20 votes. In contrast, the GCD hosts approximately 100,000 unique visitors per month. The current number of members on GCD mailing lists is also a helpful referent, with each list numbering in the hundreds or less.

    <h3>
        Different Age, Goals, and Regions
    </h3>
    <p>
        Those who are most active on the GCD&#39;s mailing lists are much more likely to index on the site than other groups.
    </p>

    <div class="chart">
        <iframe width="821" height="507" seamless frameborder="0" scrolling="no" src="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1vxUuKct_UpPjYaT2iM37lG92ZWmyxDjtWBPq0LK1OJk/pubchart?oid=1181706750&amp;format=interactive"></iframe>
    </div>

    <p>
        Those active on lists and Facebook tend to be older and more concentrated in the middle of the site&#39;s broader age distribution.
    </p>
    <div class="chart">
        <iframe width="821.233153638814" height="507.87219730941706" seamless frameborder="0" scrolling="no" src="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1vxUuKct_UpPjYaT2iM37lG92ZWmyxDjtWBPq0LK1OJk/pubchart?oid=1302050362&amp;format=interactive"></iframe>
    </div>

    <h3>
        Regional Representation
    </h3>
    <p>
        Those active in the GCD&#39;s social forums also tend to over-represent the US and Canada. To put it another way, those from other countries tend not to engage socially with the GCD, and thus they are not proportionately represented in discussions on the GCD mailing lists or social media forums.
    </p>
        <div class="chart">
            <iframe width="821" height="507" seamless frameborder="0" scrolling="no" src="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1vxUuKct_UpPjYaT2iM37lG92ZWmyxDjtWBPq0LK1OJk/pubchart?oid=1726793282&amp;format=interactive"></iframe>
        </div>

    <h3>
        Social Engagement
    </h3>
    <p>
        By asking a series of questions about posting to Facebook or GCD mailing lists, we were able to compare visitors by their level of social engagement around the GCD. Women seemed noticeably less likely to engage in active conversation online through GCD channels. Social channels aside from Facebook and mailing lists had very low numbers of followers from the group of respondents.
    </p>

        <div class="chart">
            <iframe width="816.5" height="504.8691666666666" seamless frameborder="0" scrolling="no" src="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1vxUuKct_UpPjYaT2iM37lG92ZWmyxDjtWBPq0LK1OJk/pubchart?oid=1743548956&amp;format=interactive"></iframe>

    <h3>
        Researchers
    </h3>
    <p>
        Researchers are essential to the GCD&#39;s mission to maintain and disseminate historical information on comics. Researchers in particular have the power to legitimize the organization for others and hold it to higher standards.
        However, a relatively small percentage of researchers actively engage socially with others about the GCD.
    </p>

        <div class="chart">
            <iframe width="821.233153638814" height="507.87219730941706" seamless frameborder="0" scrolling="no" src="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1vxUuKct_UpPjYaT2iM37lG92ZWmyxDjtWBPq0LK1OJk/pubchart?oid=578664927&amp;format=interactive"></iframe>
        </div>
    <p>
        Furthermore, researchers were less likely than active indexers to prefer the GCD to other databases.
    </p>

        <div class="chart">
            <iframe width="821.233153638814" height="507.87219730941706" seamless frameborder="0" scrolling="no" src="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1vxUuKct_UpPjYaT2iM37lG92ZWmyxDjtWBPq0LK1OJk/pubchart?oid=644569414&amp;format=interactive"></iframe>
        </div>
    <p>
        These researchers tended to read comics in more languages than others and were also more often interested in modern comics
    </p>

    <h3>
        Better Search
    </h3>
    <p>
        The survey allowed respondents to enter free form comments about the site and, aside from praise from those already very engaged with the GCD, the most noticeable trend was requests for better search.
    </p>

    <h2>
        Recommendations
    </h2>
    <h3>
        Improve Search
    </h3>
    <p>
        The most common free form comment for the survey was to improve search. While many long-term uses have adapted to the existing search system, it is a long ways off from state of the art best practices, and can easily be either too intimidating to learn or too complex to quickly yield a simple answer to a simple question, such as what was the most recent superman comic in the US.
    </p>
    <p>
        Moving forward, it would be good to consider multiple entry points to search, for users who mean to do different things with a search system. These entry points could lead to search queries already calibrated to specific needs.
    </p>
    <h3>
        Create International Variations of the Site
    </h3>
    <p>
        GCD visitors speak many languages, but the website only offers versions in English, German, Dutch, and Swedish. A front page in French, Spanish, Italian, German, and Portuguese might better serve existing visitors. Furthermore, a feature that would filter results to a user&#39;s preferred languages would simplify site navigation considerably.
    </p>
    <h3>
        Track Characters and Creators
    </h3>
    <p>
        A major failing of the GCD versus its competitors is that characters and creators are not tracked by the database across comics. For many fans today, these are the two most important elements of a comic and are the ways they would like to explore comic history.
    </p>
    <p>
    <h3>
        Redesign Indexing Interface
    </h3>
    <p>
        Many indexers commented that the indexing system is quite difficult to use, and this has been known by the GCD tech team for some time. This requires a substantial change to backend technologies, but is possible and worthwhile.
    </p>
    <h3>
        Conduct Further Research
    </h3>
    <p>
        Followup interviews with researchers and other preferred user groups could greatly help the GCD understand where it is, and is not, fulfilling its mission. Our current research also did not reach those using the new &ldquo;My Comics&rdquo; site, who could be the subject of further work.

    <h2>
        Research Methods
    </h2>
    <h3>
        The Survey
    </h3>
    <p>
        This survey measures visitors who felt motivated to complete a survey in English within a fairly short window during which it was open. This may over- or under-represent various populations. The language barrier is the most obvious, but for instance we are probably seeing fewer respondents who prefer other sites to the GCD simply because such visitors likely do not come here regularly.
    </p>
    <h3>
        How We Grouped Social Engagement
    </h3>
    <p>
        Based on a series of questions about posting to mailing lists and the Facebook page, as well as following various social media channels, we grouped together those who said that they actively post as “Active.” Those who said they read the mailing list or followed some social media channel were grouped as &ldquo;Follows.&rdquo; Those who did not indicate any online social engagement were labeled &ldquo;Not Social.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <h3>
        How We Grouped Reasons for Using the GCD
    </h3>
    <p>
        A series of questions about reasons that the respondent uses the GCD were summarized in three non-overlapping categories of user type. Those who said that they indexed comics on the site were grouped together, regardless of other answers, as &ldquo;Interactive&rdquo; users. They interact with the GCD data set, and therefore should be regarded differently from others. Those who said they used the site for academic work, for research, or for writing were grouped together as “Research” users. Finally, those who did not give any of those reasons, but did use it for collecting or personal reasons were assigned to a final group of those whose use is exclusively &ldquo;Personal.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <h3>
        Geographic Regions
    </h3>
    <p>
        We created several regions to prevent a lot of tiny slices while grouping things geographically. Australia and New Zealand are grouped with the one respondent each from South Korea and the Philipines who both listed English as their only language. We&#39;ve labeled this the &ldquo;Pacific Anglophone&rdquo; region.
    </p>
        <div id="regions" class="inline_chart"></div>
        <div id="european_countries" class="inline_chart"></div>
        <div id="latin_countries" class="inline_chart"></div>
        <div id="pacific_countries" class="inline_chart"></div>
    <p>
        The other regions are what you would expect, with the three largest country populations (U.S., U.K., and Canada) standing on their own. Note that there is only one respondent in the &ldquo;North Africa&rdquo; region, an active indexer in Libya who indexes comics in Arabic. Unlike with the Pacific Anglophone grouping, we decided not to put him in with Europe due to the language difference. There were no other respondents from Africa or Asia.
